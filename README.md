Codename: Monkey 

An expense tracking and splitting tool that leverages LLMs for core functionality, allowing users to log expenses using natural language input, such as “Restaurant with Bob and Alice $200.”

I also plan to explore additional features, including:

* Take a photo of a receipt, tag who ordered what, and have it automatically split up.
* Import bank statements that get categorized and split automatically, with the tool learning from past imports to improve over time.

The goal is to push beyond the classic chat UI and explore new UI/UX possibilities enabled by LLMs. This project also allows me to experiment with a new tech stack, including React 19 with RSC, NextJS 15, AI SDK, and EdgeDB (layered on top of Postgres).
